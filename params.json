{"name":"Bootstrap Input Prefix","tagline":"Prefix your Bootstrap form input fields with icons on the inside left of the field","body":"# Bootstrap Form Input Prefix Icons\r\n\r\nThe **bootstrap-input-prefix** library is a small add-on for Twitter's Bootstrap CSS framework that enables you to add glyphicons (or Font-Awesome icons) into your form input fields. By default, Bootstrap includes the concept of feedback icons for form fields. These are typically used to place an icon on the inside right of a form field to indicate the validation state of the field (i.e. a checkbox for a valid field). This doesn't allow you to place icons on the inside left of the form field, however. Hence the need for **bootstrap-input-prefix**.\r\n\r\n## Screenshot Example\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of bootstrap-input-prefix in action](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/167845/7336618/d9ff3f24-ebff-11e4-88b4-cab1c76fa89e.png)\r\n\r\nSee the `examples/index.html` file for more usage examples.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use, simply load the CSS file in your HTML page *after* the line where you load Bootstrap:\r\n\r\n\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/path/to/bootstrap-input-prefix.min.css\">\r\n\r\nUsing the library works almost identically to the feedback icons that come with Bootstrap itself. Simply add a `has-prefix` class to the `form-group` block, and add the `form-control-prefix` class to the glyphicon. You can also use this library with Font-Awesome icons.\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"form-group has-prefix\">\r\n\t\t<label class=\"control-label\">Regular Input Field</label>\r\n\t\t<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Search our site...\">\r\n\t\t<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-search text-muted form-control-prefix\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\nThe library also works with small and large input fields without any additional classes. Simply add the `input-sm` or `input-lg` class to the `<input>` element like you normally would.\r\n\r\nYou can also use the library with horizontal forms, for example:\r\n\r\n\t<form class=\"form-horizontal\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"form-group has-prefix\">\r\n\t\t\t<label class=\"control-label col-sm-3\">Regular Input Field</label>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"col-sm-9\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Search our site...\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-search text-muted form-control-prefix\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>            \r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</form>\r\n\r\nInline forms work too, but to get them right you need to wrap the input field and the icon in a `span` element with the class `prefix-wrapper`:\r\n\r\n\t<form class=\"form-inline\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"form-group has-prefix\">\r\n\t\t\t<label class=\"control-label\">Regular Input Field</label>\r\n\t\t\t<span class=\"prefix-wrapper\"> \r\n\t\t\t\t<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Search our site...\">                \r\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-search text-muted form-control-prefix\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t</span>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</form>\r\n\r\nThe icons also inherit validation state colors if you add a `has-success`, `has-warning` or `has-error` class to your `form-group` block. For the color to work, ensure you are not overriding the color of the icon using a class like `text-muted` like I am in the exmaples above.\r\n\r\n## Using with Feedback Icons\r\n\r\nNote that using the prefix icons and feedback icons on the same field at once is not currently supported. If you try to do this, you'll find that one of the icons displays off the vertical center. This will be addressed in a future release.\r\n\r\n##Â Source\r\n\r\nThe LESS source code for this library is included in the `src` directory. To build, you will need to import the Bootstrap `variables.less` and `mixins.less` files at a minimum or it will fail.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe library has been tested with Bootstrap version 3.3.1. Older versions are not supported and there are no plans to do so in the future. It should be compatible with the same desktop and mobile browsers that Bootstrap itself is:\r\n\r\n* Chrome (latest version on Windows, Mac OS X, Android and iOS)\r\n* Firefox (latest version on Windows, Mac OS X and Android)\r\n* Internet Explorer (version 8 and above, Windows only)\r\n* Opera (latest version on Windows and Mac OS X only)\r\n* Safari (latest version on Mac OS X and iOS only)\r\n\r\nUnofficially, the library should work with Chromium and Chrome for Linux, Firefox for Linux and Internet Explorer 7, but these browsers are not officially supported.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nbootstrap-input-prefix is released under the MIT license and is copyright 2015 Array Software.
